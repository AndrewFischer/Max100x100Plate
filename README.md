# Max100x100Plate
<br>
This is a base plate and template for Max 100x100 modules.  A single 100x100 board or two [50x100 boards](https://github.com/AndrewFischer/Max50x100Plate) mount on the 100x100 plate.<br>   

The design rules constraints are set for JLCPCB capabilites. Use the board as template or import the settings into your PCB. <br>

The design rule constraints and predefined sizes are a **starting point** for new layouts. <br>
